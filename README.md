# cucumber-framework

1. An example Cucumber framework designed to test the site "http://automationpractice.com/index.php".
2. This framework contains Selenium code to drive the browser and test the web application.
3. Uses a Maven project structure and written in Java.
4. Tests are written in Gherkin and are stored in feature files.
5. The framework utilizes the Page Object pattern.
6. Logging is done using Log4j.
7. TestNG is used to run and annotate the tests.

8. This is a work in progress, I am still adding new tests/feature files and trying to improve the framework.
